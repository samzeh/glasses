AR glasses that recognize people and recall what you know about them.

Spec: [Face Recognition Pipeline PRD](https://claude.ai/artifact/WMPP82KGZY6X5vqPi84Rhw).

## Status

Server-side face recognition only — the six stages of the PRD's hot loop, plus
the schema and the measurement harness they depend on. Nothing else from the
PRD is built yet: no firmware, no ingest, no trigger, no audio pipeline, no
identity resolution, no surfacing.

```
src/glasses/
  face/
    config.py      thresholds, in one place, with CALIBRATE markers
    types.py       the values passed between stages
    detect.py      1. detect          SCRFD, + primary-subject choice
    align.py       2. align           Umeyama similarity transform -> 112x112
    quality.py     3. quality gate    score, size, blur, pose, luminance
    embed.py       4. embed           ArcFace buffalo_l, 512-d
    gallery.py     ---                in-memory and pgvector backends
    match.py       5. match           cosine, mean of a person's top 3
                   6. resolve         match / low confidence / unknown
    pipeline.py    the six, wired, with per-stage timings
  evaluation/
    verification.py  TAR at a fixed FAR, swept over gallery size
  db/
    schema.sql     the full data model, not only the face tables
```

Everything holding real logic runs on numpy alone. Only `detect.py` and
`embed.py` need model weights, and both sit behind Protocols, so the suite runs
without downloading anything.

## Running it

```sh
uv venv && uv pip install -e . --group dev
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

With the models, for real frames:

```sh
uv pip install -e '.[face,db]'
```

```python
from glasses.face import ArcFaceEmbedder, FacePipeline, InMemoryGallery, ScrfdDetector

pipeline = FacePipeline(ScrfdDetector(), ArcFaceEmbedder(), InMemoryGallery())
result = pipeline.process_frame(frame)          # one frame
index, result = pipeline.best_frame(burst)      # pick the best of a burst
```

## Three things that are load-bearing

**The quality gate runs before the embedder, not after.** Rejecting a bad frame
is cheaper than recovering from the bad embedding it produces, and the gate is
what buys the accuracy target. It should reject 60–80% of ESP frames; the
capture burst exists so that is affordable. If the pass rate comes out far
below 20%, the camera settings are wrong, not the gate.

**Every embedding carries its model name and version, and every search filters
on both.** The gallery will be re-embedded at least once — probably buffalo_l
to AdaFace. Without this, a swap silently mixes incomparable vectors in one
index and recognition collapses in a way that reads as a threshold problem.

**A person is scored by the mean of their top 3 template similarities, never by
a centroid.** A centroid built from one good frontal and one bad profile is
worse than either, because the mean vector describes a face nobody has. Mean
rather than max of the top 3 is a further choice: max turns a single lucky
template into an identity, which is where false accepts come from.

## The numbers in `config.py` are not findings

They are starting points, and several are marked CALIBRATE. The PRD is right
that published thresholds are measured on clean benchmark photos and will not
transfer to an OV2640 behind a plastic lens. In particular
`min_blur_variance = 60.0` is a placeholder from webcam-grade imagery and
`accept_threshold = 0.40` is the PRD's starting value, not a measured one.

`nose_frontal_fraction` is the exception — it is derived from the ArcFace
canonical reference rather than guessed, since that reference is already the
pipeline's definition of frontal.

Calibrating needs a held-out set of a few hundred frames from the real glasses
camera across real conditions, labelled by person. `glasses.evaluation` sweeps
the threshold against such a set and reports the operating point at a fixed
FAR, at each gallery size. Track false-accept rate against gallery size from
the first measurement: a threshold tuned at ten people produces steady
misidentifications at two hundred, and it degrades gradually enough that you
will not notice without the chart.

## Known gaps

- Yaw and pitch come from a landmark heuristic with two constants that need
  calibrating. A weak-perspective PnP solve against a canonical 3D 5-point
  model is the principled upgrade, once there is a held-out set to score it on.
- `PgVectorGallery` is written but untested — it needs a Postgres with
  pgvector to test against.
- No anti-spoofing and no re-identification across clothing changes. Both are
  deliberately excluded from v1.

## Privacy

`schema.sql` carries `person.consented_at`, `media_asset.retention_expires_at`
and a soft-delete column on every table holding biometric data, because the
PRD puts the consent and deletion paths in M0 rather than retrofitting them.
The deletion job that enforces retention is not written yet. Until it is, do
not capture anyone.
