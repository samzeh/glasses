# glasses

AR glasses that recognize people and recall what you know about them.

Spec: [Face Recognition Pipeline PRD](https://claude.ai/artifact/WMPP82KGZY6X5vqPi84Rhw).

## Quick start

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # or prefix every command with .venv/bin/
uv pip install -e '.[face]'      # ~400 MB of wheels

glasses check                    # downloads the models on first run, ~280 MB
glasses enroll --name "Sam" --consent "myself" --camera
glasses watch
```

That is the whole loop: teach it your face, then let it look at you.

`check` prints dependency versions, weights digests, and what is in the store.
If it is clean, everything below works. On macOS the first camera command
triggers a permission prompt — if it never appears, enable your terminal under
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera.

## What you are doing

It is a contacts list keyed by face. Two steps, and the first is the one
people skip: **nothing can be recognised until it has been shown.**

1. **Enroll** — show it a face and give it a name. It stores a few 512-number
   vectors per person. Not the photos: the images are read and dropped.
2. **Identify** — show it a face and ask who that is. It compares against
   everyone enrolled and answers with a name, "possibly a name", or unknown.

Everything is local. There is nothing to upload and no account: the models run
on your machine and the gallery is a directory you can delete.

### Step 1 — enroll yourself, from the webcam

No photo files needed:

```sh
glasses enroll --name "Sam" --consent "myself" --camera
```

A window opens. Look at the camera, then slowly turn your head left, right, up
and down. It captures 6 *different* views and stops. Near-identical frames are
skipped deliberately — six copies of one angle is worse than three genuinely
different ones, because the matcher averages duplicates into the same number a
single template would have given.

From photos instead, for someone who isn't in front of you:

```sh
glasses enroll --name "Dan Kim" --consent "asked him on 2026-10-23" photos/dan/
```

`--consent` is required and the note is stored with the person. That is the
PRD's posture, not politeness: enroll only people who have actually agreed.

### Step 2 — see if it knows you

```sh
glasses watch
```

Live webcam with a box round each face and a name above it:

| box | meaning |
|---|---|
| green | matched someone enrolled |
| amber | saw a face, but the frame failed the quality gate |
| grey | no face found |

The latency counter is top-left. `q` quits and prints p50/p95.

Or over still images:

```sh
glasses identify some-photos/
```

```
sam-at-desk.jpg
  primary  Sam (0.612)  iod=138px blur=492 yaw=+5 pitch=-11
  18 ms
stranger.jpg
  primary  unknown best=0.104  iod=132px blur=320 yaw=-16 pitch=-10
  17 ms
```

The number after the name is cosine similarity. Above 0.40 is a match, 0.35 to
0.40 is "possibly", below is unknown. `iod` is the face width in pixels, and
it is the figure that decides whether any of this can work on real hardware.

### If it says "unknown" when it should know you

Normal, and worth reading rather than fighting. Check in this order:

- `glasses people` — are you actually enrolled, with more than one template?
- Is the frame being rejected before it is ever matched? `identify` prints the
  failing gate terms. `pitch` dominating means the pose constant needs
  calibrating, not that your face is wrong.
- Is `iod` under 80px? Then the face is too small for the embedder and the
  answer is to get closer or raise the resolution, not to lower the threshold.

### Every command

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `glasses check` | dependency versions, weights digests, what is in the store |
| `glasses enroll --name N --consent "…" --camera` | capture 6 views from the webcam |
| `glasses enroll --name N --consent "…" photos/` | same, from image files |
| `glasses identify photos/` | run the pipeline over images and print verdicts |
| `glasses watch` | live webcam, boxes and names |
| `glasses people` | who is enrolled, and their consent record |
| `glasses forget "Sam"` | delete a person and all their data, in one operation |
| `glasses calibrate-pose frames/` | measure `nose_frontal_fraction` for your camera |
| `glasses bench frames/` | per-stage latency against the budget |

`--store DIR` moves the gallery, `--help` works on any subcommand.

The store is a directory (`glasses-store/` by default): an `.npz` of vectors
beside a JSON index. Delete it to start over.

### As a library

```python
from glasses.face import ArcFaceEmbedder, FacePipeline, InMemoryGallery, ScrfdDetector

pipeline = FacePipeline(ScrfdDetector(), ArcFaceEmbedder(), InMemoryGallery())
result = pipeline.process_frame(frame)  # one frame
index, result = pipeline.best_frame(burst)  # pick the best of a burst
```

Tests need none of that — numpy alone:

```sh
uv pip install -e . --group dev && .venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

## What is built

Server-side face recognition only — the six stages of the PRD's hot loop, plus
the schema and the measurement harness they depend on. Nothing else from the
PRD exists yet: no firmware, no ingest, no trigger, no audio pipeline, no
identity resolution, no surfacing.

```
src/glasses/
  face/
    config.py      thresholds, in one place, with CALIBRATE markers
    types.py       the values passed between stages
    detect.py      1. detect          SCRFD, + primary-subject choice
    align.py       2. align           Umeyama similarity transform -> 112x112
    quality.py     3. quality gate    score, size, blur, pose, luminance
    embed.py       4. embed           ArcFace buffalo_l, 512-d
    gallery.py     ---                in-memory and pgvector backends
    match.py       5. match           cosine, mean of a person's top 3
                   6. resolve         match / low confidence / unknown
    models.py      loading ONNX nets, and digesting the weights
    pipeline.py    the six, wired, with per-stage timings
  evaluation/
    verification.py  TAR at a fixed FAR, swept over gallery size
  db/
    schema.sql     the full data model, not only the face tables
  store.py       file-backed people + templates, for M0
  cli.py         glasses check / enroll / identify / watch / bench
```

Everything holding real logic runs on numpy alone. Only `detect.py` and
`embed.py` need model weights, and both sit behind Protocols, so the suite runs
without downloading anything.

## Measured latency

Apple Silicon, 1280×886 frame, 6 faces detected, 2 through the gate:

| stage | CPU | CoreML | budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| detect | 44 ms | 9.6 ms | |
| align | 0.6 ms | 0.4 ms | |
| quality gate | 1.1 ms | 0.7 ms | |
| embed (2 faces) | 149 ms | 6.5 ms | |
| match | 0.1 ms | 0.1 ms | 50 ms |
| **total p50** | **192 ms** | **17.6 ms** | **400 ms** |

The budget is the PRD's server-side share; upload and render are not included.

**CoreML is the default where available, and it is free.** Same ArcFace
ResNet-50 weights, so there is no accuracy trade — measured cosine between CPU
and CoreML embeddings of the same crop is 0.9998, three orders of magnitude
below the gap the 0.40 accept threshold cares about, and a gallery built on one
provider matches probes from the other. It costs ~5 s of graph compilation at
first inference, once per process. `GLASSES_PROVIDERS=CPUExecutionProvider`
pins it back, which is what to do if two machines must agree bit for bit.

At 20× headroom, speed is not the constraint. Accuracy on real ESP frames is.
The smaller `buffalo_s` pack (MobileFaceNet, 13 MB) embeds in 10 ms on plain
CPU if you ever need it, but it trades accuracy for a budget that is already
met — the opposite of the direction this needs to move. The PRD's AdaFace swap
is the one worth making, and it is about low-quality imagery, not speed.

## Three things that are load-bearing

**The quality gate runs before the embedder, not after.** Rejecting a bad frame
is cheaper than recovering from the bad embedding it produces, and the gate is
what buys the accuracy target. It should reject 60–80% of ESP frames; the
capture burst exists so that is affordable. If the pass rate comes out far
below 20%, the camera settings are wrong, not the gate.

**Every embedding carries its model name and version, and every search filters
on both.** The gallery will be re-embedded at least once — probably buffalo_l
to AdaFace. Without this, a swap silently mixes incomparable vectors in one
index and recognition collapses in a way that reads as a threshold problem.

**A person is scored by the mean of their top 3 template similarities, never by
a centroid.** A centroid built from one good frontal and one bad profile is
worse than either, because the mean vector describes a face nobody has. Mean
rather than max of the top 3 is a further choice: max turns a single lucky
template into an identity, which is where false accepts come from.

## The numbers in `config.py` are not findings

They are starting points, and several are marked CALIBRATE. The PRD is right
that published thresholds are measured on clean benchmark photos and will not
transfer to an OV2640 behind a plastic lens. In particular
`min_blur_variance = 60.0` is a placeholder from webcam-grade imagery and
`accept_threshold = 0.40` is the PRD's starting value, not a measured one.

`nose_frontal_fraction` is the one to fix first, and it has already bitten
once. Deriving it from the ArcFace canonical reference gives 0.495 and looks
principled — that reference *is* the aligner's definition of frontal. It is
still wrong, because the constant belongs to whatever produces the landmarks,
and SCRFD puts its nose keypoint near 0.66. With 0.495 the estimator read
near-frontal faces as pitched down 45°, and the pitch gate threw them away.

Measure it on your own frames before trusting it:

```sh
glasses calibrate-pose path/to/frames/     # use 50+ roughly frontal faces
```

That also reports how much apparent pitch comes from face shape alone. On the
tiny sample available here it is ±20°, which is most of the ±30° gate — so if
`pitch` dominates your rejections, suspect this term before the camera.

Calibrating needs a held-out set of a few hundred frames from the real glasses
camera across real conditions, labelled by person. `glasses.evaluation` sweeps
the threshold against such a set and reports the operating point at a fixed
FAR, at each gallery size. Track false-accept rate against gallery size from
the first measurement: a threshold tuned at ten people produces steady
misidentifications at two hundred, and it degrades gradually enough that you
will not notice without the chart.

## Known gaps

- Yaw and pitch come from a landmark heuristic whose constants are calibrated
  on 6 faces. A weak-perspective PnP solve against a canonical 3D 5-point
  model is the principled upgrade, once there is a held-out set to score it on.
- `watch` has been exercised on still images but not on a live camera here.
- `PgVectorGallery` is written but untested — it needs a Postgres with
  pgvector to test against.
- No anti-spoofing and no re-identification across clothing changes. Both are
  deliberately excluded from v1.

## Privacy

`schema.sql` carries `person.consented_at`, `media_asset.retention_expires_at`
and a soft-delete column on every table holding biometric data, because the
PRD puts the consent and deletion paths in M0 rather than retrofitting them.
The deletion job that enforces retention is not written yet. Until it is, do
not capture anyone.
